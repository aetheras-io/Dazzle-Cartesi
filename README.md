# Dazzle Dapp

## Cartesi local environment setup
1. Prepare wallet
2. Launch cartesi rollup in local (host-mode or prod-mode)

### Wallet Prepartion
- Before testing, you'll need to setup Metamask chrome extension and make sure your wallets and balance are ready.
- Wallets for local environment
    - If you are going to test Cartesi on your local environment, there is no need to generate your own wallets, `hardhat` framework already provided some test wallets that have sufficient balance. Just use the test mnemonic words `"test test test test test test test test test test test junk"` to import the test wallets into your Metamask.
    - Make sure you switch network to `localhost:8545`, and change the chainId to `31337`

- Wallets for Goerli testnet (In cloud environment)
    - In wiki: [Instructions for testing Dinder Cartesi mode](https://github.com/aetheras-io/Dinder/wiki/Instructions-for-testing-Dinder-Cartesi-mode)

### Testing Cartesi in development phase (Host-mode on local)
- Start up Rust dapp on host
```
cd ./server
make debug
```
- Open another terminal window, launch Cartesi Rollups in host-mode
```
cd ./cartesi-dapp
make host-mode
```
- Wait for the Cartesi Rollups to settle down and stop pop up error message, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following, then you can start testing
```

```
- If you want to shutdown Cartesi Rollup
```
cd ./cartesi-dapp
make shutdown
```

### Testing Cartesi in deployment phase (Prod-mode on local)
- Build Rust binary for Cartesi environment
```
cd ./server
make build-cartesi
```

- Build docker images for Cartesi Rollups
```
cd ./cartesi-dapp
make images
make prod-mode
```
- Wait for the Cartesi Rollups to settle down and stop pop up error message, eventually the container logs will repeatedly show the following, then you can start testing

- If you want to shutdown Cartesi Rollup
```
cd ./cartesi-dapp
make shutdown
```
```
